  	<h1>The X·FACTOR of Xoriant</h1>
    <p>
      From its inception, Xoriant has been a technology leader and execution partner throughout the Build, Run and Transform lifecycle for companies that create technology products, as well as for enterprises that use those products to implement business solutions. Our customers range from startups to Fortune 100 and encompass BFSI, High Tech, Healthcare, Pharma, Industrial Manufacturing, Telecommunications, and Automotive sectors.

      Over three decades, Xoriant and its engineers have employed a rigorous and disciplined approach, resulting in two significant improvements for accelerated product delivery: We have abstracted and captured the most successful methodologies, framework components, accelerators, and technologies for solving important client challenges. Next, in support of these innovations, we have codified and standardized the engineering methodologies, implementation best practices, measurement methods, and early warning mechanisms, while leaving room for continuous enhancements. This is the “X·FACTOR” – the secret sauce of Xoriant – that ensures robustness, extensibility, and continuity for all the technology we deliver.</p>
